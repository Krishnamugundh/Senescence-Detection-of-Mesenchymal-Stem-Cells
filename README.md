## Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are crucial for regenerative medicine due to their ability to differentiate into various cell types and their immunomodulatory properties. Detecting senescent MSCs is essential as they exhibit reduced therapeutic potential. This project employs advanced deep learning techniques to accurately identify senescent MSCs.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Pre-processing
The dataset comprises images from five donors at different time points, each stained for actin and nucleus. Images were captured using an Olympus IX83 fluorescence microscope and pre-processed to remove artifacts and standardize the dataset.

### Model Architectures
We utilized the following pre-trained models:
- **DenseNet121**
- **ResNet18**
- **GoogLeNet**
- **Faster R-CNN**

#### DenseNet121
DenseNet121 is known for its dense connectivity pattern, which enhances gradient flow and feature reuse.

#### ResNet18
ResNet18 is a residual network that addresses the vanishing gradient problem by allowing gradients to flow through shortcut connections.

#### GoogLeNet
GoogLeNet uses inception modules to capture multi-scale features efficiently.

#### Faster R-CNN
Faster R-CNN, combined with a ResNet50 backbone, excels in object detection tasks, making it suitable for identifying senescent cells.

### Training Procedure
We fine-tuned the pre-trained models using the following techniques:
- **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: To prevent overfitting
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss for classification

### Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices were used to analyze the classification performance in detail.

### Model Performance Comparison
| Model       | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| DenseNet121 | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx%      |
| ResNet18    | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx%      |
| GoogLeNet   | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx%      |
| Faster R-CNN| 91.6%    | xx%       | xx%    | xx%      |

## Conclusion
The Faster R-CNN model demonstrated the highest accuracy in detecting senescent MSCs, making it the most effective model for this task. The other models also showed competitive performance, indicating the robustness of deep learning techniques in this domain.

## Future Work
Future research could explore integrating multi-omics data, transfer learning techniques, and validating model performance on clinical samples. Additionally, optimizing models for real-time analysis and developing interactive visualization tools are promising directions.
